title: Jekyll Minimalist
---
This website is a minimalist boilerplate hosted on [GitHub Pages][pages].

Create your [standalone
website](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/standalone.html) in few minutes
without installing anything or touching the command line. All you need is
your GitHub account (or email).

## Quick Start

1. [View source of this site on GitHub][source].
1. Click on **Fork** button.
1. You may need to **Sign in** (or **Create an account**).
1. Go to **Settings** of your new repository and rename it to
   `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your username on GitHub.
1. Check (on **Settings** page) that **GitHub Pages** is enabled.
1. Your site should be available at:

    https://USERNAME.github.io/

## Add your pages

1. Click on **Create new file** in your new repository.
1. Type-in file name, e.g. `about.md`
1. Put some file content like this:

```
---
title: About
---

This site is clean and beautiful.
```

It is important to use front matter with `title` in every file. The new
page should be available at `https://USERNAME.github.io/about`. It's
derived from its file name.

## Custom domain (optional)

Add `CNAME` file to your repository with your domain name. For example:

    www.romanzolotarev.com

Then add `CNAME` record to DNS zone for your domain that points to
`USERNAME.github.io`. For example:

    ;; CNAME Records
    www.romanzolotarev.com. 300 IN CNAME romanzolotarev.github.io.

Now your site should be available via your domain name. In case of those examples at:

    https://www.romanzolotarev.com/

## Install Jekyll on your computer (optional)

GitHub Pages uses [Jekyll][jekyll] to do all this magic. If you are
familiar with git, then you may want to install GitHub Pages (with Jekyll)
on your computer. So you will be able to edit your pages locally (e.g.
when you are offline) and view your site locally before publishing.

For example, to install it on macOS run the following commands. First,
clone your repository and run Jekyll locally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io
    $ cd USERNAME.github.io

Install `bundler`:

    $ gem install bundler

...and then `jekyll` with `jekyll-livereload` plug-in:

    $ bundle install

Start your local web server:

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --increment

While Jekyll is running, open <http://localhost:4000/> in your browser.
Your site should be there. You can add and edit pages and Jekyll will
automatically regenerate HTML files.
